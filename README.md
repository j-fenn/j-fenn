## Hello all, I'm Jack Fenn 

I am a Master's student in **AI & Computational Drug Discovery and Development** at UCSF. Here are some cool things I've done and am doing:

 **Winner, NEXT.BIO SF Tech Week Hackathon (2025)**

### **Current Research & Work** 
* **Shoichet Lab:** Benchmarking **Boltz-2 & AlphaFold 3** against the Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA) to predict off-target drug interactions.
* **UCSF Innovation Ventures:** Catalyst Accelerator Intern commercializing novel neurotech devices.
* **Cell Simulation & Polypharmacology:** Developing a **GEARS-based** (Graph-Enhanced Gene Activation and Repression Simulator) model trained on the **Xaira X-Atlas** (8M cells) to predict synergistic effects of combinatorial gene perturbations.
* **De Novo Design:** Engineered protein binders for **Nipah Virus (NiV-G)** using **BoltzGen**; designs selected for **experimental validation**.

### **Technical Stack** 
* **Generative AI & DL:** Boltz-1/2, AlphaFold 3, RFdiffusion, GEARS, GraphRAG, PyTorch
* **Bioinformatics:** OHDSI/OMOP (ATLAS), PyMOL, NONMEM, scRNA-seq Analysis
* **Languages & Ops:** Python (Pandas/NumPy), R, Bash, SQL, Git, AWS (EC2), HPC (Wynton)
* **Domain Expertise:** Pharmacokinetics (PK/PD), Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD), Polypharmacology

### **Connect**
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackfenn/)
